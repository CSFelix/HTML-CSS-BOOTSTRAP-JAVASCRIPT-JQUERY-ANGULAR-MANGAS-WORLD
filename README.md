# 🌟 Mangas' World 🌟

### `❓ What's it? ❓`

* Mangas' World was my first web site made since I started coding. Nowadays, there are the Alpha and Beta Versions.
* Alpha Version contains just HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no libraries) and you can see Animes' News and "buy" mangas!.
* Beta Version contains HTML, CSS and Javascript with some libraries, as BootStrap3 and JQuery. In it, you can just see Animes' News and some products (without simulate shopping!).

* How I has made this website in 2018, the Animes' News are more or less olds and I needa translate both to English some day 😂😂
